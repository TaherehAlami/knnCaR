\title{Compare knn_s3 models using error metrics}
\usage{
\method{anova}{knn_s3}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{\link{knn_s3}}.}

\item{...}{further arguments.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{Model}: the deparsed call for each model,
  \item \code{k}: number of neighbors used in each model,
  \item \code{Error}: training error (MSE for regression, error rate for classification),
  \item \code{DeltaError}: difference in error compared to the previous model.
}
Invisibly returns this data frame after printing it.
}
\description{
This function performs an analysis of variance (ANOVA)-style comparison of multiple
\code{knn_s3} models based on their training error. For regression models, the mean
squared error (MSE) is used; for classification models, the misclassification error
rate (1 - accuracy) is calculated. The differences in error between successive models
are also reported.
